# PitchPredict
Using Machine Learning to try to predict pitches in baseball.

In order to use the pitch prediction notebook, the user will first have to go to https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search and search for a list of pitchers they are interested in. I would recommend setting pitch minimum to >=1000. Save the metadata into a csv and upload that when requested at the beginning of the notebook.
This project was done using Google Colab.
